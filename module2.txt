-IMAGE PROCESSING WITH OPENCV AND PILLOW

-Video: What is a Digital Image
---A rectangular array of numbers.
---Each cell in the array represent a pixel on the screen.
---The number in each pixel is called the intensity value, aka the intensity of the color at hand.
---Greyscale images are made up of different shades of grey, using only black and white colors while colored images are made up of three primary colors Red Green and Blue(RGB).
---Each number ranges from 0-255 (256 intensity values for the color).
---The more intensity values that an image can have, the more clarity of colors will be present.
---An RGB image has 3 different "channels", or in other terms, 3 different arrays for each color in RGB.
---Image masks are usually black and white, where white represents the object to identify and the rest is black.
---A video sequence is a sequence of images.
